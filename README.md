# Voice-emotion-Recognition-Deep-learning
This project is realized in Python using Jupyter Notebook. You can grab the *.ipynb file here if you want to try it yourself. As a neural network framework I will be using Keras, which uses Tensorflow. Keras provides an abstraction layer to ease the use of Tensorflow.
